# Star Wars Api Project
This project simply gets all starships data from Swapi.dev, transforms the data, establish references with an existing character data and stores the results in a NoSQL database using pymongo. Eventually I want this project to be able to download all of the API data, establish relations and store the final data in a NoSQL database. 

# How to run 
1. Make sure you have MongoDB Community Server, database tools and shell are installed to your computer and exists in your system variable path.
2. This code requires you to have an already existing Star Wars character data as a collection. Be sure to save it as a collection.
3. Make sure your computer has python installed and has connection to Internet.
4. You need to have pymongo and requests library installed you can do this by using pip. (e.g. pip install pymongo)
5. Clone the repository to your computer and run the main.py file by using your preferred IDE or simply typing 'python main.py' in your terminal when being inside your repo directory.
6. Follow the instructions.
